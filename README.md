# Ignite Lab Rocketseat - Design System
This project was developed during the Ignite Lab Event conducted by Rocketseat. On the first day, we created the visual basis of the Design System in Figma and defined which tokens would be used and the components that would be part of the library in React. On the second day, we exported the Figma tokens and the components to React and then we developed the project base and the documentation using Storybook. On the last day of the event, we learned how to create automated tests for the Design System and how to simulate user interactions. In addition, we automated the deployment process.
